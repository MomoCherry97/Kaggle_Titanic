# Kaggle_Titanic

This project goes over the Titan Kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic .
This project will be updated throughout time as I will try to optimize it as I go with any ways I can see fit.
For now my next ideas are:
# Feature Engineering
  *1-Create a family variable
  *2-Look more closely at cabin numbers or ticket numbers and see if they are important
  *3- Create new feature to do with age*Class
  
  # Different outlier techniques
  # Transformation/Scaling of Fare feature.
 # Use cross Validation to choose better hyper parameters
